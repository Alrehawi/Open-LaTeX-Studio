{"name":"Open LaTeX Studio","tagline":"Open Source LaTeX editor, that supports remote collaboration","body":"### About\r\nOpen LaTeX Studio is an open source LaTeX editor, that aims to support remote collaboration between users. Unlike other dedicated services that allow project sharing, there will be no need to purchase any plans in order to obtain the space or allow more people to work on a document, since users will be able to store their projects on any, free cloud storage solution (for example Dropbox, Google drive). The GUI of the editor is built using the NetBeans Platform framework, what makes the usage of the editor simple and intuitive.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nTake a look at our [releases section](https://github.com/sebbrudzinski/Open-LaTeX-Studio/releases)\r\n\r\n### Get in touch\r\nIf you are having any problems with the application or want to raise any question, connected with the project, you are welcome to contact us via our mailing list.\r\n - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-latex-studio\r\n - open-latex-studio@googlegroups.com\r\n\r\n### Keywords\r\nLaTeX, Open Source, Java, NetBeans Platform, remote collaboration\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
